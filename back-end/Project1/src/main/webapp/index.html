        <h2>Welcome to the Story Pitch App</h2>
        <p>The purpose of the Story Pitch Management System is to provide an 
            organized pipeline for story pitches so that more new and creative stories 
            can be given the opportunity to be published. The current system relies on email 
            communication, which slows down the process and leaves some story pitches lost in the 
            clutter and delayed by weeks or even months. There is no standard method of tracking this
             process, allowing many authors who are less persistent to then fall through the cracks.</p>
             <br>
        <p>
            An author can only have a limited amount of approved stories pending through the company. The number of stories they can 
            be working on at one time depends on the type of story they have; each type has a certain “weight”
             which can add up to a maximum number of allotted “points.” With a maximum of 100, novels are each worth 50, novellas are 
             25 points, short stories are worth 20 points, and articles are worth 10 points. If an author tries to submit a pitch for a
              story for which they do not have sufficient points, the pitch will not be submitted and will instead be “on hold” so that the 
              author can re-submit at a later date when they do have sufficient points.
